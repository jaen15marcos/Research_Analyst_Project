# Research_Analyst_Project

Hi!

I performed most of the tasks in R and Python. I used both because for some reason while cleaning the data in R, an error occurred so I decided to export my R data CSV and continue cleaning the data in python.

1. Data Cleaning, Processing and Analysis Files: ResearchAnalyst.R & csv_creation.py 
2. Data File: data.xlsx
3. Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uCLhjXHMDqJYpKPg_0r_1BUt7mzXN_HLTOu3Dzu6B00/edit?usp=sharing or Market Share of Equity Trading across Canadian Marketplaces.pdf (file)
